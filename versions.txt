jan 19	2.1	Fix step 0 (return init), make resetAll which takes a vector of length 10, step() repeats the simulation if more steps than duration have been performed
jan 17 	2.0	Throw exceptions for illegal rates (too large, too small); Have parameter names according to rate (lambda) or expectation value (mu)
jan 17	1.5	Fix rounding; Change input parameter for immigration; Improve exception text from Simulation constructor
jan 15	1.4	Add more setters for matlab-interface, add static indices which explain the array returned by step()
jan 15	1.3	Add method for matlab invocation. First methods to adjust simulation rates (birthrate)
